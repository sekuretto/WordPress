-------------------------------
Minimum permissions for your homedir: 701
Minimum permissions for your public_html dir: 701 (705 to enable directory listing) (All other files and directories in your homedir should probably be 600 and 700, respectively)
Minimum permissions for directories under public_html: 701 (705 to enable listing)
Minimum permissions for static files under public_html (everything except php): 604
Minimum permissions for php files under public_html: 600
